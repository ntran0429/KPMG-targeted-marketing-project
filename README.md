## Data Cleaning

data-cleaning1: perform data quality assessment

data-cleaning2: convert to appropriate data types, impute missing values

data-cleaning3: create target variable for each customer based on RFM scores.


## EDA + Feature Engineering

Since our business goal is to identify the highest value customers out of the provided list of 1000 customers for targeted marketing, it's reasonable to **perform EDA before the data split for training**.
The reasoning is that we want to correctly identify **this specific list of customers**, not to necessarily generalize across any list.
